What's in this Release
======================

This release is available in two forms:
    Deployment Bundle - infusion-1.2.zip 
    Source Code Bundle - infusion-1.2-src.zip

In addition to source code, samples and tests, both bundles include at the top level a single JavaScript file

    InfusionAll.js

that is a combination of all other source files. Developers can include this single file in their
pages to provide all the necessary support for the Infusion component Library. In the Deployment Bundle,
this script is compressed and suitable for production use.

The Deployment Bundle also includes a WAR file suitable for deployment in Java-based containers: 
        fluid-components-1.2.war

Source Code
-----------
The organization of the full source code for the Infusion library is as follows:

        components/
             inlineEdit/
             pager/
             progress/
             reorderer/
             tableOfContents/
             uiOptions/
             undo/
             uploader/
        framework/
             core/
             fss/
             renderer/

             json/
             swfobject/
             swfupload/

In the Deployment Bundle, the JavaScript source has been minified: comments and whitespace have
been removed. 

Developers wishing to learn about the Fluid Infusion code, or debug their applications, should use
the Source Code Bundle.

Known Issues
============

The Fluid Project uses a JIRA website to track bugs: http://issues.fluidproject.org.
Some of the known issues in this release are described here:

FSS:
    FLUID-2504: Flexible columns don't maintain proper alignment under certain conditions
    FLUID-2434: In IE, major font size changes break text positioning within form controls

Framework:
    FLUID-2577: Renderer performance can be slow on IE 6 and 7 in some contexts.

Inline Edit: 
    FLUID-3632: Chrome 4 in WIN XP does not allow tabbing out of tinyMCE editor's edit field
    FLUID-3611: Text persists in edit mode when view mode displays default text: using IE 6
    FLUID-2536: Inline Edit test fails using IE 8
    FLUID-1600: Pressing the "Tab" key to exit edit mode places focus on the wrong item

Layout Reorderer: 
    FLUID-3089: If columns become stacked, can't drag item into lower column
    FLUID-1540: Can't use keyboard reordering to move a nested reorderer to the right column, using IE6
    FLUID-858:  Portlet Columns load with no padding between them in IE7

Pager:
    FLUID-3584: Clicking page numbers throws an error: using IE 6
    FLUID-2880: The Pager will be refactored. Note that as a result of this, there will be significant changes to the Pager API
    FLUID-2329: The self-rendering mode of the Pager is not the default mode

Renderer: 
    FLUID-3493: Renderer appears to corrupt templates containing empty tags on Opera (maybe others)
    FLUID-3277: Attempt to add children to leaf component in tree results in "targetlump is undefined" error
    FLUID-3276: Enclosing branch nodes within markup which has "headers" attribute causes them to become invisible to the renderer

Reorderer: 
    FLUID-3288: Moving an item with the keyboard "loses" the "ctrl-key is down" status
    FLUID-118:  Dragging an image offscreen or out of the frame has some unexpected results.

UI Options: 
    FLUID-3621: The text in buttons does not change size.
    FLUID-2481: "Links" selection does not work correctly in UIOptions
    FLUID-2398: Minimum font size control changes the text size even when the base size is larger then the minimum.
    
Uploader: 
    FLUID-3241: Can only tab to the "Browse Files" button once: using IE
    FLUID-2052: Cannot tab away from the "Browse Files" button with Flash 10*
